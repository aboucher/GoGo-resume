About
~~~~~

My formation is in distributed systems, geostatistics and physics simulation. Furthermore, during my undergraduation I participated of three IBM/ACM ICPC national finals (south america/Brazil).

I have a Computer engineering's bachelor degree and a Electric engineering's master degree from UFPA (Universidade Federal do Pará - Federal University of Pará).

Since 2008, I'm working with project and development of GUIs using Qt, distributed programming in C++, algorithm design and compiler development. And, since 2013, I work with Python.

Currently, I'm concluding a phd degree in Computational Geostatistics (Natural Reservoir modelling using computers) at UFRGS (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul) and I am computer scientist at Ar2Tech.

Some relevant experiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Computer scientist at Ar2Tech , *2017* - today 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


AR2GAS and Distributed algorithms for Geostatistics simulation
_______________________________________________________________

  Currently, I'm developing AR2GAS at Ar2tech, a new geostatics software with support to Distributed Computing and cloud. 
  
  Also, I give support to AR2GEMS and develop customized algorithms on demand. 


Researcher and PhD student, LPM-UFRGS (Laboratório de Planejamento e pesquisa Mineiro/UFRGS, *2013* - *2017*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I worked with development of geostatistical algorithms, AR2GEMS plugins developments and I did contributions to  AR2GEMS project, like python plugins support, multi-thread support.    


Researcher and MsC student, LANE (Laboratório de Análise Numérica em Eletromagnetismo)/UFPA, *2008* - *2012*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LANE SAGS - Simulator for grounding analysis
_____________________________________________
  I worked with improvement and support. I developed a new QT4 GUI and I trained new users.
  
  During this project, I learned many concepts about distributed systems (MPI), openMP, pthreads, QT multi-thread environment, networking programming, C++.
  


LANE MAXWELL - *meshless* simulator for electro-magnetics wave propagation
__________________________________________________________________________
  During my master degree, I worked with electro-magnetics wave propagation, using a *meshless* maxwell equation discretization (RPIM - Radial Point Interpolation Method)
  
  This system was developed in C++ and have a QT4 GUI. Currently, this software is a open source project called GoGoRPIM (`lanemaxwell`_).


Open Software Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Clever Language - Implementation of multi-thread support and others features (FFI, ncurses, etc.) 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
  I designed and developed the Clever parallellism model. Furthermore, I work in improvement of  many features in the language.
  
  The Clever is developed by a member of PHP "core" team, Felipe Pena. 
  
  


Events and contests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


South America/Brazil finalist at ACM ICPC  2008, 2009 and 2010 
______________________________________________________________
  With the GoGo40 team, I attended three consecutives ACM ICPC south america finals.
  

Golden medal at SBM/MEC OBMEP 2005 (Brazilian Public School Math Olympiads 2005 promoted by Brazilian Math Society and Education Ministery)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  During my high school, I gained a golden medal at OBMEP 2005.
